## Overview

`MissionHideoutCinematicView` represents a view-layer object, usually responsible for projecting game state into a screen, scene, or interactive UI.

## Mental Model

Treat `MissionHideoutCinematicView` as a View-style extension point: first identify who creates it, who owns it, and who calls it, then decide whether you should subclass it, compose it, or only read from it.

## Key Methods

`public override void OnMissionScreenTick(float dt)`

**Purpose:** Called when the `mission screen tick` event is raised.

## Usage Example

```csharp
var view = new MissionHideoutCinematicView();
