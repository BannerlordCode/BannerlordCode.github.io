# ChangeVillageStateAction

## Mental Model

Treat `ChangeVillageStateAction` as an entry point or data node for this subsystem: inspect its properties first, then decide which methods to call.

**Namespace:** TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.Actions
**Module:** TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem
**Type:** static class
**File:** `Bannerlord.Source/bin/TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem/TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.Actions/ChangeVillageStateAction.cs`

ChangeVillageStateAction is a set of static methods that trigger "ChangeVillageState" in the campaign for a specific reason. Mods call its `Apply*` overloads to change game state (one per reason).

public static void ApplyBySettingToNormal(Settlement settlement)
