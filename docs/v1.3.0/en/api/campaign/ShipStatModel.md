## Overview

`ShipStatModel` is a rule model that usually defines how a subsystem should compute things. Modders most often customize behavior by replacing or subclassing it.

## Mental Model

Treat `ShipStatModel` as a Model-style extension point: first identify who creates it, who owns it, and who calls it, then decide whether you should subclass it, compose it, or only read from it.

**Purpose:** Gets the current value of `ship tierf`.

### GetShipFlagshipScore
`public abstract float GetShipFlagshipScore(Ship ship)`

**Purpose:** Gets the current value of `ship flagship score`.
