# SallyOutsCampaignBehavior

**Namespace:** `TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.CampaignBehaviors`
**Module:** `TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem`
**Type:** `public class SallyOutsCampaignBehavior : CampaignBehaviorBase`
**File:** `TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem/CampaignBehaviors/SallyOutsCampaignBehavior.cs`

## Overview

SallyOutsCampaignBehavior lives in the TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem module, source file TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem/CampaignBehaviors/SallyOutsCampaignBehavior.cs. It is a public class, implementing/inheriting CampaignBehaviorBase; the inheritance chain is SallyOutsCampaignBehavior → CampaignBehaviorBase → ICampaignBehavior. It exposes 3 public/protected members: 3 methods.

> Batch first draft: every signature is taken verbatim from the decompiled bannerlord-1.4.6 source. What each method actually does, when to call it and where it breaks must be read from the method body in the source file.

## Mental Model

Structural facts: SallyOutsCampaignBehavior is a top-level type in TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem, namespace differing from (TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.CampaignBehaviors) the module directory; inheritance chain SallyOutsCampaignBehavior → CampaignBehaviorBase → ICampaignBehavior. The surface is method-led (methods 3/3, properties 0/3), so it mostly exposes operations. This page lists real signatures only: what each method does, when to call it and where it breaks must be read from TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem/CampaignBehaviors/SallyOutsCampaignBehavior.cs or the deep page for this type.
