# NotablesCampaignBehavior

**Namespace:** TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.CampaignBehaviors
**Module:** TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem
**Type:** `public class NotablesCampaignBehavior : CampaignBehaviorBase`
**Base:** `CampaignBehaviorBase`
**File:** `TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem/CampaignBehaviors/NotablesCampaignBehavior.cs`

## Overview

`NotablesCampaignBehavior` lives in `TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.CampaignBehaviors` and exposes the state, behavior, or workflow entry points of that subsystem to mod developers through its public members. Read its properties as “what state it owns” and its methods as “what actions it allows”.

## Mental Model

Start from namespace `TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.CampaignBehaviors` to place it in the stack, then inspect its public methods: if it mainly exposes Get/Set members, it is likely a state object; if it centers on Create/Apply/Execute verbs, it behaves more like a service or workflow entry point.

## Key Methods

### RegisterEvents
`public override void RegisterEvents()`

**Purpose:** Handles logic related to `register events`.

### SyncData
`public override void SyncData(IDataStore dataStore)`

**Purpose:** Handles logic related to `sync data`.

### OnNewGameCreated
`public void OnNewGameCreated(CampaignGameStarter campaignGameStarter)`

**Purpose:** Called when the `new game created` event is raised.

### SetInitialRelationsBetweenNotablesAndLords
`public void SetInitialRelationsBetweenNotablesAndLords()`

**Purpose:** Sets the value or state of `initial relations between notables and lords`.

### OnNewGameCreatedPartialFollowUp
`public void OnNewGameCreatedPartialFollowUp(CampaignGameStarter starter, int i)`

**Purpose:** Called when the `new game created partial follow up` event is raised.

## Usage Example

```csharp
var value = new NotablesCampaignBehavior();
value.RegisterEvents();
```
