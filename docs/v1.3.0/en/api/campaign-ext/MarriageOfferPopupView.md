## Overview

`MarriageOfferPopupView` represents a view-layer object, usually responsible for projecting game state into a screen, scene, or interactive UI.

## Mental Model

Treat `MarriageOfferPopupView` as a View-style extension point: first identify who creates it, who owns it, and who calls it, then decide whether you should subclass it, compose it, or only read from it.

## Usage Example

```csharp
var view = new MarriageOfferPopupView();
```
