# DeploymentView

**Namespace:** TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.View.MissionViews.Singleplayer
**Module:** TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade
**Type:** `public class DeploymentView : MissionView`
**Base:** `MissionView`
**File:** `Bannerlord.Source/Modules.Native/TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.View/TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.View.MissionViews.Singleplayer/DeploymentView.cs`

## Overview

`DeploymentView` represents a view-layer object, usually responsible for projecting game state into a screen, scene, or interactive UI.

## Mental Model

Treat `DeploymentView` as a View-style extension point: first identify who creates it, who owns it, and who calls it, then decide whether you should subclass it, compose it, or only read from it.

## Key Methods

### AfterStart
`public override void AfterStart()`

**Purpose:** Handles logic related to `after start`.

### OnRemoveBehavior
`public override void OnRemoveBehavior()`

**Purpose:** Called when the `remove behavior` event is raised.

## Usage Example

```csharp
var view = new DeploymentView();
```
