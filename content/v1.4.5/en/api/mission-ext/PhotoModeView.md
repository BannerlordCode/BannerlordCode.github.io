# PhotoModeView

**Namespace:** TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.View.MissionViews.Singleplayer
**Module:** TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade
**Type:** `public class PhotoModeView : MissionView`
**Base:** `MissionView`
**File:** `Bannerlord.Source/Modules.Native/TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.View/TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.View.MissionViews.Singleplayer/PhotoModeView.cs`

## Overview

`PhotoModeView` represents a view-layer object, usually responsible for projecting game state into a screen, scene, or interactive UI.

## Mental Model

Treat `PhotoModeView` as a View-style extension point: first identify who creates it, who owns it, and who calls it, then decide whether you should subclass it, compose it, or only read from it.

## Usage Example

```csharp
var view = new PhotoModeView();
```
