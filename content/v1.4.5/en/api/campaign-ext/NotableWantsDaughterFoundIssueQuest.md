# NotableWantsDaughterFoundIssueQuest

**Namespace:** SandBox.Issues
**Module:** SandBox.Issues
**Type:** `public class NotableWantsDaughterFoundIssueQuest : QuestBase`
**Base:** `QuestBase`
**Area:** campaign-ext

## Overview

`NotableWantsDaughterFoundIssueQuest` lives in `SandBox.Issues`, and its public surface shows that it acts as a formal extension or data entry point for this subsystem.

## Mental Model

Start from namespace `SandBox.Issues` to place it in the stack, then inspect its public methods: if it mainly exposes Get/Set members, it is likely a state object; if it centers on Create/Apply/Execute verbs, it behaves more like a service or workflow entry point.
