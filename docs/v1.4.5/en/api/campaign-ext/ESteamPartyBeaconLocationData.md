# ESteamPartyBeaconLocationData

**Module:** Steamworks
**Type:** `class`
**Base:** none
**File:** `Bannerlord.Source/bin/Steamworks.NET/Steamworks/ESteamPartyBeaconLocationData.cs`

## Overview

`ESteamPartyBeaconLocationData` behaves like a data carrier: it packages fields so systems can exchange state in a structured form.

## Mental Model

Treat `ESteamPartyBeaconLocationData` as a Data-style extension point: first identify who creates it, who owns it, and who calls it, then decide whether you should subclass it, compose it, or only read from it.

## Usage Example

```csharp
var value = new ESteamPartyBeaconLocationData();
```
